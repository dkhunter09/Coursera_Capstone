Since WFH allows us not to be in the cities where are companies are, we can begin to expand ideas on where we might want to relocate.  This could be utilized as the \"engine\" behind a GUI front-end for persons/families to pick their own city destinations and categories of venues for their decision-making process.  "

As stated, we don't need to look at schools, but do like parks, restaurants, and music/entertainment venues.  Also, we want to look at the housing costs, and the supply/demand of housing in that cities by zip code.  \n\nTo do this, I will use the Foursquare data to get the venues (and categories) for the cities of Kansas City, Missouri (we live in a suburb of Kansas City, but would love to move downtown if we stayed once our daughter was off to college), Fort Collins, CO, and Portland, OR.  \n\nFor the data on housing data, I will use data from Realtor.com (specifically, RDC_Inventory_Hotness_Metrics_Zip_History) that has current data (202004) on Housing inventory and hotness metric data that will supply the median_listing_prices, supply_score, demand_score, and median_listing_price_vs_us by zip code.  This data will allow us to look at the three cities and compare the median housing price, the comparison to the median price to rest of US (our current zip code is a +2 from the median price in US), and a gauge on the supply/demand index calculated by Realtors.com (high # up to 100 is level of either category) to gauge the housing market in that city.\n\nAll this data will allow us to compare zip codes(areas) in those cities that would be best suited for starting a search as well as compare cities if we needed to make a decision"
